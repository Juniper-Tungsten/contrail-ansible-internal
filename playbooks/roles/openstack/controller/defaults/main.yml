# sensitive_services: there are certain services which fail to come up properly when they start along with package installation.
# There can be different reasons for that
# 1. may be services are not configured correctly
# 2. any errors to be fixed in postinst scripts
# 3. Docker containers doesnt support upstart, and thus if a package try to start services,
#    which only have upstart script will cause package installation fail
# Adding those service names here avoid them to start during package installation
# NOTE: This will only work on Debian/Ubuntu systems
sensitive_services:
  - statd
